    <!-- If you have any questions, add them in paragraph tags here! -->
    <p>Is there appropriate or accepted syntax for writing comments that arent part of the code, specifically, where to write them, or is it just wherever it is most relevant to the actual code?</p>
    <p>will we eventually learn the differences for links and scripts and why some code for linking a js file or sourcing a css file seems to have "extra" elements, but appears to function the same?</p>
