    <p>See console for output.</p>
    <!-- If you have any questions, add them in paragraph tags here! -->
    <p>Is there globally accepted syntax for where to write comments that arent part of the code, or is it just wherever it is most relevant to the actual code?</p>
    <p>I don't have a great grasp on when to use the 'switch' statement as opposed to an 'if/else,' but specifically for a comparison where the output is a boolean value, switch seemed kind of clunkier than if/else. <br />  Will there be situiations with comparisons or boolean expressions where switch statements are better than an if/else?</p>
    <p>Will we eventually learn the differences for links and scripts and why some code for linking a js file or sourcing a css file seems to have "extra" elements, but appears to function the same?</p>
